<p>This page is mostly stuff about me. You can get to all my projects/code using the blue 'View on Github' image at the top OR by clicking on <a href="https://github.com/mrcartier" class="user-mention">@mrcartier</a>. I'm a technology consultant based in Queens, NY involved in smart home/building automation solutions and mobile application development. I regularly interface with control system professionals, engineers and other executive personnel when working in commercial settings. In contrast, residential settings afford more of an opportunity to manage the project from A - Z. Both present a different set of challenges and rewards. to give the client  This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<p>One common theme I regularly see with systems is a shift from being isolated to full enterprise integration; from RS-232 to cat5/6. Through systems integration and network technologies control systems are becoming more analogous to traditional IT systems in terms of connectivity. We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
