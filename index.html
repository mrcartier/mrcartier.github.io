<p>This page details some of my work. You can see my projects/code using the blue 'View on Github' image at the top OR by clicking on <a href="https://github.com/mrcartier" class="user-mention">@mrcartier</a>. I'm a technology consultant based in Queens, NY involved in smart home/building automation security solutions and mobile application development. I regularly interface with control system professionals, engineers and other executive personnel when working in commercial settings. In contrast, residential settings afford more of an opportunity to manage the project from A - Z. Both present a different set of challenges and rewards. </p>

<p>One common theme I regularly see is a shift from being isolated to full enterprise integration; from RS-232 to cat5/6. Through systems integration and network technologies control systems are becoming more analogous to IT systems in terms of connectivity. However most systems lack robust security as they are unable to run anti-virus, malware or other similar software applications. This leads to a situation where none of the communication is private and anyone who has the system IP address can gain unlimited access.</p>
<p>With a mobile app users can monitor and control the system remotely through several solutions that (depending on the manufacturer) range from a proprietary application to series of web pages. Mobile development also brings redundancy; in the event the primary touchscreen/touchpanel interfaces fail the mobile device can still be used to control the system.</p>

<p>More of our home devices will be able to be controlled over the internet (Nest Thermostat, August Smart Lock, DVR, garage door, etc.) yet it remains to be seen if/when those connections will rival traditional IT security. Right now people are willing to sacrifice security for convenience, only time will tell if that will change.</p>
<p>REST APIs and MBaaS are helping mobile applications become more powerful. The average person spends just as much or more time on their phone or tablet as they do on the computer when checking emails. But people are starting to use their mobile devices for banking, paying bills and other traditional functions in addition to email and social networking. We can expect the use of mobile devices and applications to steadily increase over time. </p>
