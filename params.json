{"name":"MrCartier","tagline":"Github Pages Home","body":"### Welcome to my (GitHub Pages) Homepage.\r\nThis page is details some of my work. You can see my projects/code using the blue 'View on Github' image at the top OR by clicking on @mrcartier. I'm a technology consultant based in Queens, NY involved in smart home/building automation security solutions and mobile application development. I regularly interface with control system professionals, engineers and other executive personnel when working in commercial settings. In contrast, residential settings afford more of an opportunity to manage the project from A - Z. Both present a different set of challenges and rewards. \r\n\r\n### Current State of the Industry\r\nOne common theme I regularly see is a shift from being isolated to full enterprise integration; from RS-232 to cat5/6. Through systems integration and network technologies control systems are becoming more analogous to traditional IT systems in terms of connectivity. However most systems lack robust security as their unable to run anti-virus, malware or other similar software applications. Additionally, users can now access these systems with mobile devices (phones, tablets, etc.) which often aren't running security applications either. This leads to a situation where none of the communication is private and anyone who has knows the system IP address can gain unlimited access.\r\n\r\n### The future\r\nMore of our home devices will be able to controlled over the internet (Nest Thermostat, August Smart Lock, DVR, garage door, ...) yet it remains to be seen if/when those connections will rival traditional IT security. Right now people are willing to sacrifice security for convenience, only time will tell if that will change.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nTo reach me via github: @mrcartier\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
